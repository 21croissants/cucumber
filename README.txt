= stories

* FIX http://rspec.info/stories

== DESCRIPTION:

This code parses RSpec stories. It uses a Treetop grammar to do the job, and 
this grammar is extended by users of the library. This design makes the code
very compact, and it makes it easy to give precise line and column info on 
parse errors. Further, when a step fails, the story file will appear in the
stack trace, along with regular ruby files.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* TODO: Add a yaml file for different languages
* TODO: Custom nodes for the syntax tree
* TODO: Actually execute the stories
* TODO: Make rake run specs by default

== SYNOPSIS:

  FIX (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* gem install treetop

== INSTALL:

* gem install stories

h1. Cucumber

Cucumber is a tool for executable documentation in plain text. Cucumber targets non technical domain experts as well as
programmers and QA people. Cucumber itself is written in Ruby, but it can be used to "test" code written in Ruby, Java 
(or web applications written in any language). When "IronRuby":http://www.ironruby.net/ matures it can be used to "test"
.NET code too.

While Cucumber can be thought of as a "testing" tool, most people use it to support "BDD":http://behaviour-driven.org/, so
the "tests" are typically the first thing that gets written, and the production code is then written outside-in, to make
the test pass.
